    <!-- About Start 
		Here I make use of section tags and my javascript to dynamically update the section
		boxes. I was going to originally use flexbox but decided to use that in the how it
		works page instead. A manbox contains all of the sub boxes, these sub boxes hold all
		of the relevant information that is further explained from the readme file. When the
		user changed the selected item in the combobox, then it is dynamically updated through
		the sections located here.

        <h1 class="aboutTitleFormat"><span class="aboutTitleSpan" id ="aboutPageSub" >About</span></h1>

            <p id="box1Txt">This web page makes use of JSON data to manipulate the DOM. A drop down box is populated with JSON data parsed as a XMLHTTP request. JSON data is interesting because it can be kept in a form which is not local to the user thus creating securer web applications. I first used JSON data in one of the labs and ever since, I've wanted to incorporate it in someway, so I tested it with comboboxes, allowing this webpage to be possible. Third party JSON API data is also used inthe museum webpage to pull in weather data using the openweatherAPI. The data being pulled in is over HTTP so unsafe scripts must be loaded in browser. The weather is shown for Portsmouth in the bottom widget bar I made.'

            <img id="box2img" src="resources/images/aboutPageIcons/dropdownmenu.gif" alt="dropdown">

            <p id="box2Txt"> A combobox can be found in the top left of this page. This drop down box makes use of the JSON data discussed in the previous section. You can select the choices: about this page, motivations for this website, technologies used, and about me. When selecting another option, the page will be dynamically updated using javascript and sub-categories headers from the JSON data. The combobox will always be defaulted to the first option of the array of items. An event listener checks for onselect through the HTML5.
