For usual arangment of weapon system in this class, you will commonly find Tomahawk Block IV cruise missles which work on TERCOM navigation systems. This navigation systems can tell if the object is land or another vessel and strikes accordingly. Spearfish torpedoes are also loaded onto the submarine guided by passive sonar navigation."

       engineinfoclass.innerHTML = "This class of submarine uses a Nuclear marine propulsion system, commonly known as a nuclear reactor for seaborn vessels. A nuclear reactor will often offer power-redirection uses parts of its capability to ensure a submarines components are powered. The nuclear reactor works by taking risen heat from the gamma radiation to turn a submarines turbines. Cells of this capacity last for roughly 25 years and offer permanent submersion. This is vastly superior to a diesel-electric system." 

       operationinfoclass.innerHTML = "The UK currently have 3 active Astute-Class submarines in operation around the globe. Tasks involve safeguarding the British Isles, pan-Atlantic trade routes, and European waters. Expeditions in the Artic, Baltic and Mediterranean have also been noted. The UK is one of the few countries involved with tours to the Artic to help reduce Russian presence and keep a frontier for NATO war vessels. In the early 2000's a large scale naval operation with submarines was sent to Iraq."

The boats are being constructed by BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines at Barrow-in-Furness. Seven boats will be constructed: the first of class, Astute, was launched by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, in 2007, commissioned in 2010, and declared fully operational in May 2014. The Astute class are the replacements for the Trafalgar-class and Swiftsure-class fleet submarines in Royal Navy service."

The short-range missile IDAS (based on the IRIS-T missile), primarily intended for use against air threats as well as small or medium-sized sea- or near land targets, is currently being developed by Diehl BGT Defence to be fired from Type 212's torpedo tubes."

The Italian Navy's S526 Todaro was deployed, for over six months in 2008, to the United States for CONUS 2008 exercise with United States Navy.

Initial study started on a Type 209 improved design, with AIP capability, called Type 212.
